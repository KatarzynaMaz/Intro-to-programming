    <p>Welcome to my notes from the <b>Intro to Programming</b> course.</p>
    <p>HTML is Hypertext Markdown Language that is used to write the webpages. It is used 
    to write content that will be displayed as a web page. yes. The HTML is made of text that will be displayed in the browser
    and the markup language which says how the text will be displayed in the browser. Html inclued linkes to other pages
    and links to other pages and references to include other documents and files 
    like images and videos.</p>
    <p>There are different types of elements in HTML. The first type is called a void or empty element.
        A <mark>void</mark> element doesn't have a content, so it doesn't have a closing tag. 
        Examples of the void element are brake element and image element.
    </p>
    <h1>Inline vs block elements</h1>
    <h2>Inline elements</h2>
    <p>Inline element does not start on a new line and only takes as much width as necessary. Examples include:
        <ul>
            <li>br</li>
            <li>img</li>
            <li>span</li>
            <li>mark</li>
            <li>em</li>
            <li>a</li>
            <li>em</li>
            <li>strong</li>
            <li>b</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Block elements</h2>
    <p>A block alement starts on a new line. It occupies the whole horizontal space/width of its parent
        element and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, so it creates a block around itself.
        Examples include:
        <ul>
            <li>div</li>
            <li>footer</li>
            <li>main</li>
            <li>section</li>
            <li>article</li>
            <li>aside</li>
            <li>table</table>
            <li>p</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A p element tells the browser to create a little block around the element.</p>
    </p>
    <p>There are a few HTML elements that always apprear inside other elements, otherwise they don't make sense.
        A list element is a good example. A list element li always aprears inside the list (ordered or unordered). Lists, however, 
            can be nested inside each other. 
    </p>
    <h2>Examples of nested lists:</h2>
        <h3>Cleaning the house:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cleaning the bedroom</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Making the bed</li>
                    <li>Vacumming</li>
                    <li>Taking the garbage out</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Cleaning the kitchen</li>
            <li>Cleaning the bathroom</li>
            <li>Cleaning the hallway</li>
        </ol>
        <p>List element doesn't require a closing tag, but both ordered and unordered lists, do</p>
    <h2>Web Address</h2>
    <p>Every page, a file, an image on the web has its address. They are called URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). They usually startwith http:// or https:// 
    Sometimes you can take shortcust and skip htttp/s and it will work just fine in the browser as the browser will know
    you're looking for a website. But, if putting that address in the html file, you need to put absolute or fully qualified address 
    (with the http/s at the beginning because otherwise the browser will think you are referring to a file on your own computer). 
    http/https/file are called protocols, then goes:// and the domain (e.g.www.google.com). The domain tells the browser what server to connect to. 
    Example: https://www.google.com/ (after the last / is a file path - sometimes empty, when it refers to the home page)
    Example of the address of a file saved on a local computer:
    file://users/kasia/notes.html (no domain name, but it would go before users)
    </p>
    <h2>Links and Images</h2>
    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>An element for creating a link is called a and it is called anchor elelment (because it anchors/connects an address to a piece of text on a page.</p>
    <a href="https://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>
    <h3>Images</h3>
    <p>Tag for an image is img. It has to have a src and alt atribute (falterante description, or search engines or visually impaired people
        to know what it is in the picture.
        Here is an example of an image:
        <img src="https://placebear.com/800/600" alt="image of a bear">
        <p>To create an image that is also a link to a different page, we need to put image tag between
            the beginning and the closing tags of the a element. 
            Example: 
            <a href="https://google.com"><img src="glogo.png" alt="Google!" target="_blank"></a>
        </p>
