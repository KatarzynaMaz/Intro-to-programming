    <p>Welcome to my notes from the <b>Intro to Programming</b> course.</p>
    <p>HTML is Hypertext Markdown Language that is used to write the webpages. It is used 
    to write content that will be displayed as a web page. yes. The HTML is made of text that will be displayed in the browser
    and the markup language which says how the text will be displayed in the browser. Html inclued linkes to other pages
    and links to other pages and references to include other documents and files 
    like images and videos.</p>
    <p>There are different types of elements in HTML. The first type is called a void or empty element.
        A <mark>void</mark> element doesn't have a content, so it doesn't have a closing tag. 
        Examples of the void element are <br> and <img>.
    </p>
    <h1>Inline vs block elements</h1>
    <h2>Inline elements</h2>
    <p>Inline element does not start on a new line and only takes as much width as necessary. Examples include:
        <ul>
            <li>br</li>
            <li>img</li>
            <li>span</li>
            <li>mark</li>
            <li>em</li>
            <li>a</li>
            <li>em</li>
            <li>strong</li>
            <li>b</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Block elements</h2>
    <p>A block alement starts on a new line. It occupies the whole horizontal space/width of its parent
        element and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, so it creates a block around itself.
        Examples include:
        <ul>
            <li>div</li>
            <li>footer</li>
            <li>main</li>
            <li>section</li>
            <li>article</li>
            <li>aside</li>
            <li>table</table>
            <li>p</li>
        </ul>
        <p>A p element tellss the browser to create a little block around the element.</p>
    </p>
    <p>There are a few HTML elements that always apprear inside other elements, otherwise they don't make sense.
        A list element is a good example. A list element li always aprears inside the list (ordered or unordered). Lists, however, 
            can be nested inside each other. 
    </p>
    <h2>Examples of nested lists:</h2>
        <h3>Cleaning the house:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cleaning the bedroom</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Making the bed</li>
                    <li>Vacumming</li>
                    <li>Taking the garbage out</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Cleaning the kitchen</li>
            <li>Cleaning the bathroom</li>
            <li>Cleaning the hallway</li>
        </ol>
