    <p>HTML is Hypertext Markdown Language that is used to write the webpages. It is used 
    to write content that will be displayed as a web page. yes. The HTML is made of text that will be displayed in the browser
    and the markup language which says how the text will be displayed in the browser. Html inclued linkes to other pages
    and links to other pages and references to include other documents and files 
    like images and videos.</p>
    <p>There are different types of elements in HTML. The first type is called a void or empty element.
        A void element doesn't have a content, so it doesn't have a closing tag. 
        Examples of the void element are <br> and <img>.
